Workshop materials

This repo contains materials for an introduction to text analysis with R.

Those new to R should begin by downloading R: https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/
and by installing RStudio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

After clicking the link to download R, choose to follow the install instructions for your particular operating system. For Windows machines, choose "Install R for the first time." Then, choose "Download R 3.6.1 for Windows" and follow the instructions (defaults are fine).

For Mac, scroll down to the "Latest Release" section and click the "R-3.6.1.pkg" link. Follow the instructions (defaults are fine).

For RStudio, follow the above link and choose the RStudio Desktop Free version. Follow the instructions (defaults are fine).

The workshop begins with a presentation found in our drive folder:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i_D_UjBtFa7Vpy37yj6blF3yA5xqF8kE

There, you can also find an HTML version of the r markdown document included in this repository. To view, download the HTML file from the Google Drive folder and open it in a browser of your choice.

The presentation goes over ideas about data analytics and R basics.

The r markdown document in this repo includes examples and activities for workshop participants to explore.

When we get to the part of the workshop where we will be using the r markdown document, if you have git on your machine, choose "create new project" in RStudio and choose to do so from version control. Select Git and copy and paste the repo address. RStudio will clone the repo for you. Once cloned, open the wwcodeDHIGEventNotebook.Rmd file.

If you do not have Git, you can also download the project from here. We can walk through setting your working directory in RStudio to the project directory.
